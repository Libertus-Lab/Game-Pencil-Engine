Good evening,

I'm adding the altered sdl2 module here, please note you can't have both SDL2 and Raylib in same project, but here is the SDL2 Module( Original module), changed the folder name from sdl_libs to sdl2_module to remain consistent.

Since the editor makes sue of image/surface transformations I will be adding these into the main render base class.
