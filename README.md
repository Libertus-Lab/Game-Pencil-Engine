Donate to make Game Pencil Engine greater
=========================================
Work on this engine is not possible without funding. The amount of time it takes to update the codebases, create examples, tutorials and more is quite expensive. Please consider either a one-time or monthly donation to keep this engine going and more frequently updated. 

We have a [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/pawbyte?ty=h) that you can help fund future developments of Pencil Engine and to help us kickstart new projects!

There is also a [PayPal](http://www.pawbyte.com/donate/) one time donation method as well. 

I appreciate your generousity and moving this project forward. 


Building
========

Please checkout our guide for building from source [here](https://pawbyte.com/building-game-pencil-from-source-code/).

Currently, only the SDL2 module is completed, but more are underway, for those unfamiliar with linking dependencies this will help you get Game Pencil running on Windows, Mac, Linux and FreeBSD.

Coding with Game Pencil Engine
=======================

This editor is coded completely in C/C++ and uses a modular design for display, input, output and audio.

Currently, the first modular block is SDL2, with plans to expand to SFML, OPENGL and Vulkan in later updates.

Please note that using the .MP3/.MP4 formats is strongly not recommended due to licensing fees.
